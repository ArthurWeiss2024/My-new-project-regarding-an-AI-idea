# PROJECT NAME:  
CybersecurityAI:  Adaptive Threat Prediction and Response
## SUMMARY  
Based on today's everchanging and evolving threat matrix, it is necessary to develop an AI-driven platofrm that machine learning to quickly identify, predict and respond to cyber threats in real-time, reduce incident response time and mitigate potential Damage.
## Background
* BACKGROUND PROBLEM:  Modern digital infrastructure is under a deluge of sophisticated and rapidly evolving cyber threats.  It is no longer possible to keep paced with these unexpected and unusual attack vectors.  
* BACKGROUND FREQUENCY:  Attacks are increasing common, with ransomware, phishing and zero-day exploit impacting organizations.
* BACKGROUND PERSONAL MOTIVATION:  I have maintained a CISSP certification for 15 years.  Helping the industry to evolve and be successful is of particular importance to me.
* BACKGROUND IMPORTANCE/INTEREST:  Cybersecurity is a critical aspect of the digital infrastructure of this ever more-connected digital world.  AI offers potential to automate threat detection, improve response times, and improve overall cybersecurity posture.
DATA SOURCES:  Network Traffic Logs; System Logs; Security Information and Event Management data; Threat Intelligent Feeds, Endpoint Detection and Response data; and, Dark Web data.
AI TECHNIQUES:  Anomaly Detection - Use unsupervised learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns; Predictive Modeling - Employ Supervised learning and Deep Learning to predict future threats; Natural Language Processing - Analyze threat intelligence reports and dark web forums to understand relevant information and identify potential threats; and, Graph Neural Networks - Analyze connections between entities on a network and investigate any abnormal connections.
## How is it used
* HOW IS IT USED - CONTEXT:  Integrate into organization's existing security infrastructure to provide real-time threat detection.
* HOW IS IT USED - USERS:  Security Operations Center personnel, IT Administrator and members of Cybersecurity team would be primary users.
* HOW IS IT USED - AFFECTED PEOPLE:  Entire organization's employees, and customers would benefit from enhanced data protection
## CHALLENGES
Data Quality and Availability - Incomplete data can lead to false positives and missed threats; Adversarial Attacks - Have to protect the AI model from being poisoned with bad data; Explainability - AI can be viewed as a blackbox and can be very hard to explain certain AI decisions; and Adaptabiltiy - AI model must continue to retrain so it stays up-to-data.
## WHAT NEXT
Automate Incident Response with the model;  Threat Intelligence Sharing; Analyze User Behavior; and, Conduct Proactive Vulnerability Management.
## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS   
Threat Intelligent resources from resources like NIST and SANS; and, the isc2 website.
